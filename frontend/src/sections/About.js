                <p id="aboutparagraph">"I am Niko,an enthusiastic IT-engineering student at the University of Applied 
                Sciences with a keen interest in web development and coding, which I've pursued passionately as a 
                hobby for the past 5 years. My diverse professional background spans from video production to training
                and consulting in marketing.My family consist of partner, daughter and lovely dog Malla. Free time I spend with Dungeons and Dragons, playing guitar and spending
                time with my daughter.

                Working with micro enterprises I have always wanted to equip them with the best information, but at 
                the same time I wanted my training to be very easily approachable, ensuring everyone feels comfortable
                asking questions and contributing ideas, fostering a relaxed and engaging training environment. 
                So IÂ´m not afraid to work with customers.

                Whether brainstorming innovative strategies or delivering reliable foundational solutions, customer 
                satisfaction has been at the forefront. I take immense pride in the consistent positive feedback, 
                with clients commending our proactive approach, reliability, and unwavering dedication to excellence.
